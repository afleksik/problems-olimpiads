# Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementations of a variety of algorithms implemented in C and C++. The algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, mathematics and statistics, data science etc.. The implementations are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using different algorithm strategies and optimizations.

# Features
    The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in - C/C++.
    Each source code is atomic using standard C/C++ libraries libc and no external libraries are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
    Source codes are compiled and tested for every commit on the latest versions.
    Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.
